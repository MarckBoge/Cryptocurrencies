# Cryptocurrencies



## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to use data retrieved from CryptoCompare to provide a detailed report and show visualizations of currently traded cryptocurrencies that that can be grouping together to create a classification system. This would allow Accountability Accounting the ability to offer a new investment portfolio in the world of cryptocurrency to its customers. We will be preprocessing the data to fit an unsupervised Machine Learning Model that will allow us to run a clustering algorithm that will help us group the currencies.

In this analysis we learned and applied:

  • Preparing Data (Selection, Processing, and Transforming) - the process of helping to prepare data for Machine Learning Algorithms.
  
  • Clustering and the K-means Algorithm - the process of grouping similar objects/data points into clusters.
  
  • Elbow Curve to Find Centroids - method to determine the best number of clusters needed for the algorithm to group the objects by.
  
  • Principal Component Analysis (PCA) - statistical technique to speed up machine learning algorithms when the number of features is too high.
  
  • Visualization (hvPlot, Plotly) - graphic libraries that allows us to create 2D and 3D graphs such as, scatter plots.
